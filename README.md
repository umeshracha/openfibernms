# üåê Open Source Network Management System (NMS)

## üìå Project Description

This project aims to develop an open source Network Management System (NMS) that enables real-time monitoring, visualization, and control of IT and ISP networks. It is designed to be cost-effective, scalable, and highly customizable, making it suitable for small to large-scale network infrastructures.

The system will support automatic device discovery, performance monitoring, alerting, configuration backups, and topology mapping using standard protocols like SNMP, ICMP, and REST APIs.

## üéØ Core Features

- **Device Discovery**
  - Automatically detect and list network devices using SNMP, ICMP, and LLDP.

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Track bandwidth, CPU usage, memory, and interface statistics in real time.

- **Alerting & Notifications**
  - Send alerts via email, SMS, or messaging platforms for downtime and anomalies.

- **Network Topology Mapping**
  - Visual representation of devices and their interconnections.

- **Configuration Management**
  - Backup, compare, and restore network device configurations (e.g., MikroTik, Cisco).

- **Graphing & Reporting**
  - Generate historical performance graphs and daily/weekly reports.

- **Syslog and Event Log Integration**
  - Collect and analyze system logs for fault detection and auditing.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

- SNMP / Net-SNMP
- ICMP (Ping)
- REST APIs for supported devices
- Frontend: React.js / Vue.js (optional)
- Backend: Python / PHP / Node.js
- Database: MySQL / InfluxDB / Prometheus
- Visualization: Grafana / Custom UI

## ‚úÖ Benefits

- 100% Open Source with modular architecture
- No licensing costs, customizable for specific use cases
- Supports integration with cloud and hybrid networks
- Community-driven development and support

## üîê Optional Add-Ons

- AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis (via OpenAI or local models)
- GeoIP-based Device Location Mapping
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Telegram/Slack Integration for real-time alerts

## üöÄ Use Cases

- ISP Infrastructure Monitoring
- Enterprise LAN/WAN Management
- Data Center Network Oversight
- Educational Campus Networks
